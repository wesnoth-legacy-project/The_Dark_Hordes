Here is the main prose during the campaign.

# Campaign description

Lead fugitive dark sorcerer Gwiti Ha’atel to mastery of the undead hordes.

# Unit descriptions

## Initiate

Dabbling in the death magic, this young Ha’atel’s lust for power has weakened him to the point where he is too weak to attack in regular combat.

## Deathmaster

His wanderings on a dark path have given him power normally not granted to mortals, but with a terrible cost: the undead that he gave his soul to are gradually claiming his mortal shell too, and with time, he will be a true undead and a terror to all that lives.

## Demilich

After too much time dabbling with forbidden magics and dark arts, these magi have begun to pay a heavy price. Demiliches have started losing their bodies, becoming undead themselves. With time, they may become fully undead, and feared by all alike.

## Dread Lich

At long last, Ha’atel has paid the ultimate sacrifice for the dark arts into which he has delved, and has, himself, entered into undeath. At the apex of his power, he has become a lich, a waking embodiment of dread. He has, beyond any doubt, passed the point of no return, and his power and immortality will have to provide consolation for what he has lost in his quest to achieve them.

## Dark Spirit

Dark spirits are messengers and bearers of tidings from the realm of the dead, and a force of dread in this world. Luckily, they have rarely been seen in Wesnoth.

# 01. A New Chance

## Story

At a great battle at the Stone of Erzen, the brothers Gwiti and Nati Ha’atel showed their skills for the first time: thinking that their side was losing the battle, they called upon the corpses of former enemies to rise again and fight on their side.

However, not only was this forbidden, but rash as well. The cavalry meant to come as reinforcements instead clashed with the undead legions, and so the battle was lost where it would have been won had it not been for these two dark sorcerers.

The Ha’atel brothers fled. However, exhausted by the ritual, they were seized not long after by the Wesnothians. They were clapped in irons, marched onto a ship with no rudder, and sent off to drown in the sea, for the Wesnothians feared that their corpses might only rise again.

But fate intervened. The ship carrying Gwiti and Nati was beset by a sudden storm and disintegrated, separating the brothers and washing them both ashore. This was the beginning of the Rise of the Dark Hordes.

## Scenario start

Gwiti: Sand... blood... and something with a nasty taste. Am I still... breathing? What the hell is this strange beach?

(looking around)

Gwiti: The land is in shambles and smells disgustingly of the beasts. Apparently, the gods have not completely abandoned me — the ritual to transform us into liches failed, but the chasm between life and death saved me from drowning. And there are no Wesnothians pursuing me here, nor are there any legions of orcs.

Naga: Who is this dirty bastard? This realm is the sanctuary of our league, do not approach here!

Ogre: Human flesh! My warriors hungry! Crush bones and eat marrow!

Naga: Wait a minute, I sense quite a little unholy magic coming from him. A necromancer?

Gwiti: How amusing that these primitive creatures recognize my shadowy arts. Perhaps the gods sent them to test whether I deserve to be alive?

Gwiti: Conveniently for me, there are enough bones and souls remaining in this ruin. This will be the greatest uprising since Erzen.

## Bats found

Gwiti: Wild bats! Let me give them my magic...

(enchanting)

Gwiti: I got some great scouts on my side. But they are young, or maybe not familiar to flying enough at this time.

## Turn 7

Gwiti: However, I only wonder where my brother has disappeared to. Do the gods rightly grasp that one Ha’atel who survives is more than enough?

## Monsters appear from each village

Gwiti: Seems like a bunch of creatures were hiding in the village. Send them to their doom along with the swamp dwellers here!

### Pattern 1

Unit: Damn, you annoying mud! Be an ash!

### Pattern 2

Unit: Oh! There’s a tasty-looking fish!

## The treasure

Unit: This is where the nagas have their stash of treasure! Plunder away!

## Gwiti attacks

### Pattern 1

Gwiti: Death is the best for those who stand in my path!

### Pattern 2

Gwiti: Now is the time for your death!

## Death of Naga

Naga: My people... flee to the deep waters... the land now belongs to darkness...

Gwiti: You fool, darkness is the only remedy for you savages.

## Death of Ogre

Ogre: Grakarat... never defeated before... How can dead-man be so strong?

## Orcs appear after the death of Naga or Ogre

Gabtur: What is this? Undead roam freely through these lands? Our brethren will not be pleased!

Gwiti: Ah, more orcs. You seem even weaker than those I fought at Erzen. This land falls under my command now.

Gabtur: You dare mock us? Die with regret for your words!

Gwiti: You foolish orc! Your role in it ends here, as does your life.

### If Naga is alive

Naga: Orcs! They invade from the east! It would be wise to retreat for the time being!

### If Ogre is alive

Ogre: Orcs coming? Their meat is bad, better stay away from them!

## Death of Gabtur - Victory

Gabtur: Urgh! I never thought... I would die before seeing our triumph...

Gwiti: I care nothing for the orcish politics, but speak your final words if you must.

Gabtur: You... foul necromancer! Our brethren shall destroy you!

(falls)

Gwiti: Those creatures were not even my real opponents. Now, I would have to search for Nati. I do not believe that he has been swallowed by the waves and turned to sea debris.

Gwiti: And after all, if my brother is alive... he will surely stand against me.

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: Noooo! Not now, not when I have escaped!

(falls)

Gabtur: Hmph, get rid of the remaining undead, too!

## Time over - Defeat

Gwiti: Orcish reinforcements! I have no hope of victory if they strike heavily now...

# 02. Brother Against Brother

## Story

Leaving the conquered beach behind, Gwiti found a small cult skirmishing with orcs and saved them. He drew the young adepts to his side by force; the ritual at Erzen was incomplete, but it still steadily tainted him with the death magic.

Gwiti continued his march, exposed to occasional rain showers. But things went as he had expected — he was reunited with his brother in the wasteland.

## Scenario start

NA: As the sun set, Gwiti discovered that his arch-rival and brother, Nati, had already ensconced himself nearby.

Gwiti: Ah, hated brother mine. Look well upon the setting sun, for you shall not live to see another in this land.

Nati: This land? Do you truly not know where we are? Then you are a greater fool than I had thought.

Gwiti: Cease your blustering, fool, and prepare to die... again.

Nati: I will fight you with all my strength to prevent that, and I was always the stronger of us. Flee now and save your miserable hide before I make it a carpet.

Gwiti: Don’t be silly! I’m not hairy enough to be a carpet! But your scalp would make a good pillow.

## Bats recalled 

Gwiti: The bats seem to have taken to me well.

## Turn 5

Nati: Your doom is almost upon your doorstep, brother!

(reinforcements)

Gwiti: His legions are nothing more than a mishmash... My victory depends only on the passage of time.

## Turn 9

Nati: You miserable wretch, know that it is only by my mercy that you look upon the sun again, for you shall die before it sets.

Gwiti: May I remind you that even as we speak, my undead legions are marching towards you?

## Turn 13

Gwiti: Now the sun is setting... once again. I must slay him and go on my way of revenge as swiftly.

## Gwiti attacks

Gwiti: I am Gwiti the Mighty, prepare for your doom!

### If the target dies

Gwiti: Didn’t I tell you so?!

## Nati attacks

Nati: Now you shall be ashes!

### If the target dies

Nati: And by my own hands you destroyed!

## Death of Nati - Victory

Nati: I... have failed to win this battle. I am defeated. I don’t believe it.

Gwiti: Die, yes, die, and go to the Land of the Dead. Perhaps one day you will be back under my command!

Nati: I curse you with the last of my strength... You shall eventually be killed like me.

(falls)

Gwiti: I am always a winner and will not perish, brother.

Spirit: Gwitiii... Gwiti!

Gwiti: What are you? From where are you whispering to me?

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: What? I can’t die! I already have! Noooo!

Nati: Ha ha ha, did I not tell you it would be so? Perhaps I shall summon your shade to serve me one day. Until then... farewell!

Gwiti: It is over. I am doomed.

## Time over - Defeat

Nati: I will put an end to you right now! Brace yourself!

Gwiti: His legions surrounded me! I seem to have wasted too much time...

# 03. The Skull of Morgorath

## Story

Still wandering the Northlands, Gwiti entered lands of the orcs. They all bore skull-topped banners, but one of these skulls was special...

## Scenario start

NA: After Gwiti destroyed his brother, he planned to march on Wesnoth to gain his revenge. But a dark spirit came to counsel him...

Spirit: Gwitiii... Gwiti!

Gwiti: I am familiar with your whispering voice. Are you a sign of my mastery of the undead? You do not seem like an ordinary spirit.

Spirit: Gwiti, do not march yet in pursuit of your revenge. First, you shall go south, against the orcs, and there find the Skull of Morgorath.

Gwiti: Speak on.

Spirit: Do you see the three orcish clans of this land? Their banners are topped with skulls, as is their custom. But one of these is the Skull of Morgorath — take it and your power will grow greater by far.

(scrolls to each enemy)

Orc 1: The undead are approaching before our eyes! Time for battle, my brethren!

## Turn 9

Spirit: Gwiti, do not waste your time. His rebirth is near. The ancient power has chosen you!

Gwiti: What the hell is Morgorath? Are your words worth believing?

Spirit: The being closest to true immortality is Morgorath. And you have no choice but to follow my lead now.

Gwiti: Are you going to remain solely quiet? Very well... for I am sure that evil is always with me.

## Gwiti attacks

Gwiti: It’s been a long time since I fought anything myself!

## Death of Orc 1

Gwiti: That skull is powerless!

## Death of Orc 2

Spirit: That is not the Skull of Morgorath!

## Death of Orc 3 - Victory

Orc 3: Oh, no! The undead hordes have taken my banner!

Gwiti: It is not your banner, and it never was! That skull has marked it as mine since long ago.

(falls)

Gwiti: Argh! This is only half of the skull, and near enough to powerless! Begone, spirit! Do not approach me again!

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: No! I cannot fall so soon! My revenge... my power... all lost...

## Death of Spirit - Defeat

Spirit: You are not worthy of the Skull of Morgorath!

# 04. Mages and Elves

## Story

After sending the dark spirit away for his failure, Gwiti found some maps in the possession of the orcish soldier and searched for the next direction of the march. Craving the power that was promised to him, he turned towards the Tower of Kaleon, where the greatest magi once studied.

Gwiti headed gradually south, hiding in the darkness, to reach the land near Gray Woods. It was not easy to deceive the eyes of the elven and Northern Alliance scouts, but he knew that the artifact in the Tower of Kaleon was of sufficient worth; the Book of Crelanu.

## Scenario start

Gwiti: At last, I have reached the road. Unless I am far off my course, I should find the Tower of Kaleon here, filled with the secrets of ancient magi. Soon they shall all be mine, and my power will be great enough to invade Wesnoth.

Mage: A dark sorcerer approaches! Can this be the same one that we banished?

Mage: Accursed and dreadful one, know that we magi, guardians of the Tower of Kaleon, shall bar your way with all our spells! Flee now and you may survive.

Elf: Quirind, know that you have the elves at your back.

Elf: Foul sorcerer of death, go far from this place or we shall send you to your own realm.

Gwiti: Not born is the one that could challenge me!

## Death of Mage

Mage: Argh! I have fallen, and the tower lies stripped of its defenses!

## Death of Elf

Elf: Quirind, we have failed! You must guard the tower.

## Gwiti moves to the tower - Victory

Gwiti: Haha! I have gained entry to the tower!

Elf: A curse upon that foul dark sorcerer!

## Enemies defeated - Bonus victory

Gwiti: The way to the tower is now open. Follow me!

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: No! No! Noooo! It is over, I feel the shades reaching for me...

## Time over - Defeat

Mage: Ah ha ha ha! The tower’s protective spells are now in force, you cannot enter without mastering a magic equal to it.

# 05. Inside the Tower

## Scenario start

Gwiti: If my memory serves, this tower should have three floors. I should be able to find the book in a few hours...

## Turn 2

(reinforcements)

Revenant: Hayaargghh! We have arrived! Command us, master!

## Chests of gold - Each line

Unit: Well, well, well. Thirty-five pieces of gold were in this chest!

Unit: Blast it, the chest is empty!

Unit: Twenty pieces of gold is a welcome gift.

Unit: I suppose thirty copper coins should not be scorned...

Unit: The chest is empty save for a few trinkets. The magic has gone out of them.

Unit: Gack! This chest contains holy water!

Unit: Look at what the magi were guarding!

Unit: Those magi had hidden away more than it seemed!

Unit: Two dozen gold. Plundering this tower is fun!

Unit: A pile of assorted coins is here!

Unit: Haha, this chest holds scores of gold coins!

## Second floor

Unit: Here’s he second floor! The mages can’t hide from us for long!

## Third floor

Gwiti: The third floor! Closer! Find the book!

## Secret door

Unit: There’s a secret door here! This must be the library.

Guardian: I will not allow the likes of you to lay eyes upon the book!

## Death of Guardian

Guardian: No! The book must never fall into the hands of a necromancer!

## Gwiti finds the journal - Victory

Gwiti: This is not the tome Crelanu wrote... but it contains its whereabouts!

Revenant: We’re done in here! Let’s go slay some more enemies.

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: Nooo! Not this close to the book!

# 06. Crelanu’s Book

## Story

According to the journal Gwiti recovered, five centuries after the death of Delfador the Great, the dark sorcerer Mizenwyn found the book in the Heart Mountains.

This gave him great power and he sparked a civil war in Wesnoth, where he seized the Sceptre of Fire and the throne.

After the fall of his empire, the magi feared the book and pondered how not to let its power pass to the next evil. They decided to hide Crelanu’s work where none would find it, while spreading rumors that it was guarded in the Tower of Kaleon.

Some years later, Gwiti retraced their steps, which led him to a war-torn valley.

## Scenario start

NA: Time marched on, and so did Gwiti. He was nearing the place where the dreadful tome of Crelanu was hidden.

Gwiti: I feel that it must be close. Could it be in that swamp?

NA: But the magi had done their job well. The book had been hidden in a grove over which elves and orcs had waged war for many years, and any to approach would suffer their combined wrath...

Elf: Oh no. The orcs seem to have recruited the undead to their side.

Orc: Blast it! However did the elves get a dark sorcerer to march with them?

Gwiti: I side not with either of you!

Orc: A truce, then? I fear he will be the death of us both.

Elf: Very well. We have hated you orcs for centuries, but the undead are a danger to all that live.

## Gwiti moves to the swamp

Gwiti: The book is not here, but these swamps contain enough corpses to suit my purposes.

## Death of Elf

Elf: A curse upon that dark sorcerer! Why did he have to come here?!

## Death of Orc

Orc: I die a terrible death... not knowing why.

## Gwiti takes the book - Victory

Gwiti: At last! This is it! Now I must laugh crazily as a true villain always does!

Scout: My lord, your suspicions were correct. There is indeed a dark sorcerer in this part of the country!

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: Nooo! Not this close to the book!

# 07. Confrontation

## Story

Gwiti was spotted by one of the scouts and his presence was made known to Wesnoth. King Delvhar I sent an army led by Lord Aretu to cleanse the evil. They crossed the Great River and gradually approached Gwiti’s forces...

## Scenario start

NA: With the finding of Crelanu’s ancient tome, fresh strength had flowed to Gwiti’s forces, and they had made good time. However, Gwiti’s march was halted by Leonard, who came from Wesnoth as the captain of the advance. The general of several outlying areas, his troops were many but untrained.

Gwiti: I see that your puny kingdom marshals its troops at last... This is the first time since Erzen that I have seen this many Wesnothians.

Leonard: So you are the one responsible for our defeat at the Stone of Erzen. Without your evil intervention, we and the Northern Alliance would not have suffered that miserable loss against the orcs. Now you die forever!

Gwiti: Somehow, I have the feeling it is you who will do the dying today. I wonder why?

NA: In truth, Leonard’s army was unprepared and under-equipped, and he had neglected to send word. Luckily, behind him came one whose name was a bane to the undead: Lord Aretu. Gwiti knew that even if he defeated Leonard, his best hope was now to flee into the mountains.

Leonard: I shall slay you myself!

## Death of Leonard

Leonard: No! This cannot be true! My king, I have failed...

(falls)

Aretu: Leonard is dead? Oh, what a sad day. Come men, let us destroy those undead!

Gwiti: Only one way lies open now. I must flee where his horses cannot go: the sharp peaks and bottomless caves.

## Undead attacks Aretu

Aretu: Return to your master, dark fiend!

(teleporting)

## Gwiti escapes to the mountain pass

### If Leonard is alive

Leonard: Haha, it was a mistake of you to flee there! The pass is blocked, and my troops will slay you now!

### If Leonard is dead - Victory

Gwiti: Phew... Surely the puny humans will be too tired to follow me now!

Tanar: Oh, no, escaping dwarves only to be caught by undead.

Gwiti: Who are you? If you are a foe of the dwarves, I might consider you an ally.

Tanar: I am Tanar, lord of an orcish clan that dwelt here! My people were driven out by the dwarves. All families count several dead. Please, let us march with you, for only a chance to strike back at the evil dwarves!

Gwiti: Gladly. I do get so lonely talking to myself, and none of my minions are worth talking to.

Tanar: Thank you, my new lord! Never had I thought I would see the day when my people were glad to march alongside skeletons and ghosts.

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: So this is my doom... the cold black void...

# 08. Underground Pool

## Story

Gwiti and Tanar rushed into the maze of twisting little passages, quickly leaving the humans behind. But not much later, they ran into dwarves...

## Scenario start

Gwiti: The dwarves are still in these caves!

Tanar: Aye! They drove us out, and left a guard here to occupy us.

Gwiti: Then we shall slay them. I have never had dwarves rise to join my ranks. He, he, he, he...

## Dwarf attacks Tanar

Dwarf: Die, you dirty orc!

## Tanar attacks dwarf

Tanar: Hmph! You’re the one who’s going to hell!

## Dwarven treasure

Unit: The hoard of the dwarves! Three hundred pieces of gold at least!

## Gwiti moves into the water - Victory

Tanar: We have come to a flooded part of the cave. If we forge ahead, the dwarves should be delayed quite a bit.

(flashing)

Tanar: Argh! What was that?

Gwiti: I do not know. I guess, however, that some magic is at work in these caverns. Can you tell me anything of them?

Tanar: Nay, lord. These passages were flooded higher last time I was here. The dwarves did not delve here, and we shunned the nameless dread we felt.

Gwiti: If there is anything to dread here, it is me. Now, onward!

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: I feel the darkness pulling me back...

## Death of Tanar - Defeat

Tanar: You swore you would protect me!

## Time over - Defeat

Gwiti: The paladins have caught up with us! We’re trapped!

# 09. Underground River

## Story

Crossing the pool did not take long and soon the orcs and undead marched on through the damp cave, into the mountain. While the orcs shivered in the magical air, Gwiti spent some time reading the Tome of Crelanu.

## Scenario start

Tanar: The water is rising behind us, it seems to be going back to its normal level.

Gwiti: That should keep the dwarves and humans away. Let’s see what else these caves contain.

## Turn 4

Tanar: Our castle has sunk!

Gwiti: Maybe the midgets were running from the water... no matter, we can only move forward.

## Naga killed

Unit: There is a stone with a glowing rune on it here, but the light is fading quickly.

Unit: There is also a pile of gold. They won’t be needing it anymore.

## Reach the bridge

Gwiti: The water will not flood past this chasm, get across and clear out the dwarves!

Tanar: Aye! Kill the dwarves!

## Enemies defeated - Victory

Tanar: We have cleared the area, lord.

Gwiti: Block the entrances. We will be safe here for a while. Now I have to study the book...

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: Curse you dwarves! Curse you nagas! You will all die in this cave!

NA: With the power of the book, Gwiti collapsed the cave and brought down part of the mountain. Even some of the pursuing paladins were caught in the rubble.

## Death of Tanar - Defeat

Tanar: My clan will avenge this betrayal!

# 09x. Intermission

## Story

The orcs and undead easily defended the cave stronghold and when the water subsided, the nagas were driven off or slain, their magical artifact exhausted.

# 10. Return to the Northlands

## Story

Months later, Gwiti finished studying the Tome of Crelanu and departed for where he believed the other half of the Skull of Morgorath to be. The orcs, restless without an enemy to fight, eagerly followed.

## Scenario start

Vrork: Which cave-orc dares trespass on my land?

Tanar: I am Tanar. My clan and I seek passage to the north, by force if need be.

Vrork: I am the great Vrork! No weakling cave-orc will pass through my lands! Slay them, my grunts!

Tanar: My brethren, the enemy we have been yearning to fight has arrived!

Gwiti: It seems I’ll have dead orcs marching with me as well as living ones. He, he, he...

## Gwiti recruits ghoul

Gwiti: Crelanu certainly knew some interesting magic!

## Turn 4

NA: As dusk fell, Gwiti noticed the spirit he had once seen approaching close by...

Gwiti: Ah, has the shadow of a distant memory come upon me... again? I would have cast a spell for you never to approach me again.

Spirit: Gwiti. You have become mighty, indeed, and foolish. For you do not yet know the true meaning of the skull, which will soon be in your hands.

Gwiti: What do you mean? Nay... I have no longer any use for you and your delusions. So, now, disappear from my sight!

## Death of Vrork

Vrork: No cave-orc can kill me! I am the might Vro...

### If killed by orc

Orc: I didn’t know surface orcs were this fragile.

### If killed by undead

Undead: I am no orc!

### After death

Soldier: Those weaklings needed help from the undead to kill our leader! No surrender! Kill them all!

Gwiti: Yes! Stay and fight! Give me more corpses to work with!

## Enemies defeated - Victory

Soldier: We are getting slaughtered! Run for your lives!

Gwiti: Let them run! All shall fear me!

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: No! No! Noooo! It is over, I feel the shades reaching for me...

## Time over - Defeat

Gwiti: We spent too much time. Their huge reinforcements have arrived!

# 11. An Orcish Coup

## Story

Gwiti’s research directed him north, further into the orcish lands. Eventually, he could sense the presence of the skull’s other half. The feeling led him to what appeared to be an orcish capital.

## Scenario start

Gwiti: One of those three warlords has the skull, though I cannot tell which.

### If Tanar is alive

Tanar: It is a large host they have gathered here. It would be wise to avoid fighting them head on, even if they haven’t united under one banner.

Gwiti: I may have a way to assassinate the leaders, but we will need to draw away their forces...

### If Tanar is already dead

Gwiti: And the army they command is enormous; I have not seen such a mass of orcs since Erzen. There should be easier way to get to the skull, let’s see what Crelanu wrote...

Gwiti: Ah, yes, invisibility it was. I’m not sure if my dear brother qualifies as a lich though...

### Summon Nati

Gwiti: Hello brother, you will be serving as ingredients today.

NA: Some time passes...

Gwiti: This potion is powerful as it is going to get. Let’s see the effects.

(invisible)

Gwiti: This should ease the retrieval of the skull, but those chieftains will still be hard to get to.

Tanar: I can distract the patrols, but my clan cannot fight off this horde alone. You must not delay.

## Turn 5

Nati: Aaaaaaiiiiiiiiigh!

Gwiti: Dear brother, would you be so kind to explain to me why I am visible?

Nati: The light... weakens me, the magic... should resume... at dusk.

Gwiti: Perhaps you aren’t as powerful as you had thought. A lich’s eyes should keep me invisible even during the day.

## Death of Nati

Gwiti: Go back to the shades, you incompetent fool!

## Death of Orc 1

Gwiti: This chieftain does not have the skull!

## Death of Orc 2

Gwiti: Finally! The other half! Let us see what it can do!

## Death of Orc 3 - Bonus victory

### If Tanar is alive

Soldier: We surrender, our new ruler! The horde is yours to command.

Tanar: Tend to the wounded and gather your equipment. We have a campaign to plan.

### If Tanar is already dead

Soldier: Sound the retreat! But know that I will come for your skull, foul necromancer!

## Time over

### Gwiti already has the skull - Victory

Soldier: Sound the retreat! But know that I will come for your skull, foul necromancer!

### Else - Defeat

Gwiti: The skull is still out of my reach!

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: Noooo! Not so close to the skull!

# 12. Assault on Alduin

## Story

Tanar decided to use the death of the would-be Great Chiefs to subject the local tribes to his own rule. Plans to jointly invade Wesnoth were discussed.

Gwiti knew that as long as paladins and magi roamed the land, any invasion would be severely hindered. So he decided to strike at the source of his problems: Alduin.

## Scenario start

NA: Gwiti reached the southwestern part of Alduin after a long journey on the ocean floor. There were magical wards around the island, but they were not a major threat to Gwiti, who had acquired Crelanu’s knowledge.

Gwiti: Choosing the night attack seemed to be the right choice. The area is quiet — the incompetent mortals are probably asleep. By the time we start landing, my apprentice Arkal-Thil should arrive in the eastern part of the island with the rest of my servants.

## Gwiti attacks

Gwiti: Now is the time for you to perish... Be the shadow in my name!

## Attacked

Mage: The council is under attack! Let the soldiers of terrible death be judged by the light!

Gwiti: The foolish magi seem to have realized our attack by now. But it is no longer too late for them.

## Arkal-Thil appears

Arkal: Master! We have at last arrived at this place!

Gwiti: Seems to be a little later than planned, but no matter. Fight to destroy them. Search every inch of the island and kill all the council dogs.

## Enemies defeated - Victory

Mage: Impossible! Has the council been almost wiped out because of that necromancer? What kind of trick is this...

(falls)

Gwiti: We have won this battle, but it is only the beginning. My invasion of Wesnoth has finally begun.

## Death of Gwiti - Defeat

Gwiti: I feel the darkness pulling me back...

# Other minor macros and prose

## Ice potion dialogue

NA: This potion contains a strange fluid designed to imbue a weapon with the power of cold.

### If you cannot get

NA: Only a skeletal warrior may acquire this dreaded power!

## Death of Tanar but no defeat

Tanar: Avenge me, my brethren! We have been betrayed!

New leader: I never liked those undead anyway!

### Escape pattern 1

New leader: Run for your lives!

### Escape pattern 2

New leader: This looks like a good moment for a tactical withdrawal.
